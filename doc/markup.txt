        end,
    }

Here are all the available configuration options and their defaults:

>lua
    -- Options:

    --   auto_continue_lists      → Automatically continue list entries when pressing Enter on an empty line

            auto_continue_lists = true,

        typst = {
            auto_capitalize_headings = true,
            auto_continue_lists = true,
        },
        tex = { -- Filetype used for Latex
            auto_capitalize_headings = true,

        },
    }
<


USAGE ~


SMART EDITING

Just edit your Markdown file as usual — the plugin works automatically in the
background.

- When you create a heading, the first letter will be capitalized instantly.
- When you press **Enter** after a list item, the next bullet or number will be inserted for you.

No commands or configuration are required.


MOTIVATION ~

I enjoy taking notes and writing documentation in Markdown, but I’ve always
wanted certain parts of the editing process to feel more automated, much like
in a traditional word processor. I first created this functionality for my own
Neovim setup, then decided to turn it into a plugin so others could enjoy it as
well (o˘˘o)
